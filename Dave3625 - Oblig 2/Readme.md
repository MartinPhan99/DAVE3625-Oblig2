Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Assignment 2

I have chosen the first use case which is to predict the stock market prices for Norwegian airlines.

I believe the Regression algorithm is the most optimal algorithm for this use case. This is because of the fact it is benefitial to use when there is data of continous data. Stock market prices are known to fluctuate over longer/smaller periods of time and that is why a regression algorithm along with supervised machine learning is best for this use case.
I will be using the columns "Close" and "Date" in the dataset
